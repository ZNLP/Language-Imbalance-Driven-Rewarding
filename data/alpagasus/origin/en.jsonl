It is argued that external noise can drive a precarious collective intelligence system towards either order or chaos via ‘phase transitions’. Decomposition of external noise in terms of regime control and critical control is discussed as possible mechanisms for phase transitions. Internal noise is discussed with respect to the question: “How resilient is a collective intelligence system against internal noise?” Distinguishing between noise-supported and noise-stabilized collective intelligence systems concludes the article."}

But how does the relationship between humans and our furry friends work? Scientists have studied the science behind the interaction between cats and dogs and humans.\n \nThe science of pet therapy has been well researched by scientists. Studies have shown that when pets and humans interact, the people involved exhibit lower levels of stress hormones and an increased \"feel good\" hormone. Studies have also shown that petting a dog can decrease anxiety and help the person become more relaxed.\n\nStudies have found that cats are less socially interactive than dogs, but they have their own way of communicating with humans. In some cases, cats can hear a stranger's voice and knew who it belonged to without having ever met them before. Cats have been found to be social learners that rely on visual cues to interpret their environment.\n\nThe science also includes how cats and dogs adapt to their environment. Dogs are found to be social learners and learn from their environment as well as from humans. They may be able to calm a person with their presence and can be trained to do various tasks. Cats on the other hand are more independent animals and stay close to their surroundings. They can pick up behavioral cues from their environment, more than humans, which is why cats can be so entertaining to watch."}

The proposed algorithm is a reimplementation of deep deterministic policy gradient with a continuous action space, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to map frames of the game to the expected action. The experiments conducted with two variants of the Doom game showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline solution in terms of accuracy, demonstrating superior performance with deeper CNNs.\n\nThis research demonstrates the feasibility of deep reinforcement learning for game AI. With the help of deep learning techniques, our model is able to apprehend abstract concepts and perform complex navigational tasks, ensuring a high accuracy compared to the traditional approach. Exploring the performance of other deep reinforcement learning algorithms on the Doom games could further improve the overall accuracy.\n\nThe applications of the proposed approach can extend beyond game AI to robotic navigation and control tasks, image processing, and decision-making. By embracing more complex reinforcement learning techniques, such as imitation learning, hierarchical learning and meta-learning, the proposed method can be applied in various AI-driven tasks, including robotics and healthcare, combat and autonomous driving."}

With platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, it's easier for people to stay in the know and interact with friends and family, as well as thousands of other users. In addition to connecting with other people, social media can also be used to inform. For example, many news outlets use Twitter to post stories and updates that are related to the topics they cover. Others use the platform to share pieces of information and engage in discussion, as well as post pictures and videos of events as they happen, as was done during the Arab Spring.\n\nSocial media has also changed the landscape of modern marketing, allowing smaller business and organizations to reach a broader range of people. Companies and charities can use social media to promote their products, events, and causes to potential customers, donors, and followers. Social media has starkly altered how people raise awareness and money for causes, creating a more direct method for users to donate instead of relying on sponsored advertisements or traditional fundraising methods.\n\nMoreover, social media has impacted politics and political campaigns around the world. Candidates are now able to spread their message beyond traditional avenues like protests and rallies, and use social media to reach voters and supporters. During the 2016 US election, for example, candidates on all sides used Twitter to announce their candidacies, post policy platforms, debate with opponents, and more. Thus, social media has become an integral part of modern political campaigns worldwide."}
